This is a 2-story house, so I'll select 2.

Normal access - nothing difficult here.

QUESTION 5: Current condition?
Let's say moderate buildup - it's been a while since cleaned.

QUESTION 6: Service frequency?
This is a one-time clean.

Perfect! TicTacStick has calculated the time required and the
pricing based on our configured rates."
